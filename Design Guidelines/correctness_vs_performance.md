# Correctness vs Performance

* Optimize your code for correctness NOT performance
* Need to be good at READING code, not just writing
* Someone should not know name if you are a good backend dev

## Lack of Performance Comes from:

* Latency
  * Disk
  * Network
  * CPU
  * Memory
* Memory Allocation
* How Data is Accessed
* Algorithm Efficiencies
