# Prepare Your Mind

## Issues in Development

* We need to get rid of large amounts of code
* Stop making large abstractions
* Learn what mechanical sympathy is
* Performance MATTERS
* Hardware optimization
* Need to learn cost benefits in engineering
* We need to stop using so much hardware, cost is a problem in the cloud
* Throwing more people at a problem doesn't help

## What I need to do

* Champion quality, efficiency and simplicity
* Have a point of view
* Introspection matters
* Keep an open mind

## Legacy 

* What are you leaving behind?

## Mental Models

* 10,000 lines is the maximum for one developer
* Don't be attached to debuggers
* We need to refactor to get rid of bugs
* Logging is important
